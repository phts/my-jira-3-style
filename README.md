# My Jira 3 style

There are some my style improvements of corporate Jira 3.

* Portlet header have blue color (like gadgets in Jira 4+)
* Use new issue icons (e.g. ![Task](https://jira.atlassian.com/images/icons/issuetypes/task.png))
* Add more space in portlets
* Increase font size
* And more...

Can be applied using [Stylish addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) in Firefox.
